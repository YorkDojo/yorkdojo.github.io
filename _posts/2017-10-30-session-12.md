> York CoderDojo 12  took place at 29th October 2017 10-12 at Clifton Green Primary, York

This was a busy session, but we got a lot done! Emily & Onett added an ultrasonic detector
to our Arduino robot - and it worked pretty well!

Arran started experimenting with some Arduino sensors, and did more microbit stuff.

Others made some Microbit gnd Scratch games

Worksheets that we used this session:

- The Arduino group added [collision detection to our mini Arduino robot](/worksheets/arduino/robot-bumps)

And we were one year (kinda) old this session - woohoo!
