> York CoderDojo 11 took place at 0th September 2017 10-12 at Clifton Green Primary School, York

We had a quieter session this month, but didn't stop us from doing some cool stuff!

Emily S completed *all* of [Code Club's SonicPi worksheets](https://codeclubprojects.org/en-GB/sonic-pi/), will have to make her some more I think!

And Onett worked with Daniel on programming some real iOS apps - we're looking forward to seeing what they end up making.

And our newest mentor Carl worked through the Theremin Microbit worksheet, ready to help out for new pupils soon!

Happy Hacking!
